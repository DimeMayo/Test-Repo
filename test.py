Here's the revised version of the provided Python code with inline comments added for clarity and improvement:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

def divide(a, b):
    # AI Review: Check for division by zero to prevent runtime errors.
    if b == 0:
        return "Error: Cannot divide by zero!"
    return a / b

def main():
    print("üßÆ Simple Calculator")
    print("Operations: +, -, *, /")

    while True:
        num1 = input("Enter the first number (or 'q' to quit): ")
        
        # AI Review: Check for user input to quit the program.
        if num1.lower() == 'q':
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        
        num2 = input("Enter the second number: ")
        operator = input("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): ")

        # AI Review: Attempt to convert inputs to float and handle potential ValueErrors.
        try:
            num1 = float(num1)
            num2 = float(num2)
        except ValueError:
            print("‚ö†Ô∏è Invalid number. Try again.\n")
            continue

        # AI Review: Use if-elif structure to determine the operation based on user input.
        if operator == '+':
            result = add(num1, num2)
        elif operator == '-':
            result = subtract(num1, num2)
        elif operator == '*':
            result = multiply(num1, num2)
        elif operator == '/':
            result = divide(num1, num2)
        else:
            # AI Review: Handle invalid operator input gracefully.
            print("‚ö†Ô∏è Invalid operator. Use +, -, *, or /.\n")
            continue

        # AI Review: Display the result of the calculation.
        print(f"Result: {result}\n")

# AI Review: Entry point of the program to ensure main() runs when the script is executed.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Added inline comments above relevant lines to explain the purpose and functionality of the code.
- Ensured comments are helpful and non-redundant, focusing on code quality and user experience.
